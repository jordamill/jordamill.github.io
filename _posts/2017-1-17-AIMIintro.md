title: Cover-to-Cover: _Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach by Stuart Russell and Peter Norvig_
---

This is the first post on my new blog and the first in a series of posts as I read Russell and Norvig's 'Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach', which I will refer to as AIMI from here on out. My plan is to read the book cover-to-cover. I'll document my progress here by posting my responses and code for all the exercises in the book. The book seems like a thorough survey of Artificial Intelligence and I am hoping it will provide me with a rigorous foundation for future work in the field.

I started my PhD last semester and I am very grateful to be able to focus almost all of my time this semester on reading and learning about artificial intelligence. I did a senior design project using reinforcement learning in my undergrad, but it left me wanting to know more and delve deeper. This book seems like an ideal introduction to the field and will hopefully provide me with a clearer idea of where the frontiers are.
