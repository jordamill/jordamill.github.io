title: AIMI - Artificial Intelligence a Modern Approach Introduction
---

This is the first post on my new blog and the first in a series of posts as I read Russell and Norvig's 'Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach'. My plan is to read the book cover-to-cover. I'll document my progress here by posting my responses and code for all the exercises in the book. The book seems like a thorough survey of Artificial Intelligence and I am hoping it will provide me with a rigorous foundation for future work in the field.
